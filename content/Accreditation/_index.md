# Test Transactions

Once Oxipay is installed on your platform it must be verified before it can process live transactions.<br>
To do this your website must process two test transactions and be verified by someone from Oxipay.

<div class="panel">
    Before performing the test transactions, test mode must be activated in the Oxipay settings.<br>
    Please refer to the documentation for your platform.
</div>

### Performing Test Transactions

You must perform two test transactions, an approved and a declined transaction.

1 - Add a product to your cart and proceed to check out with Oxipay.

2 - Sign up for an Oxipay account using your personal information.

- Please ensure your mobile number is correct as you will need to receive a verification code.
- You must use factual personal information to be identified correctly.

<div class="panel">
    If you can't sign up please contact <a href="mailto:pit@{{< domain >}}">pit@{{< domain >}}</a>
</div>

3 - Pay the first installment using a testing credit card

- You can use the card number **5506750000004364** with any name and valid expiry date.
- A CVV of 200 will cause the transaction to decline. All other 3 digit numbers will succeed.

4 - Your transaction will be approved or declined and you will be redirected back to the web-store.

5 - Confirm that the transaction is showing up correctly in the sales records for your store.

<div class="panel">
    Once both transactions are complete, please email <a href="mailto:pit@{{< domain >}}?Subject=Oxipay Accreditation&body=Hi, %0D%0A%0D%0AMy Merchant ID is: %0D%0A%0D%0AI have performed the two test transactions on my website%0D%0A%0D%0ACould you please verify them?%0D%0A%0D%0AThanks,%0D%0A%0D%0A">pit@{{< domain >}}</a> with your merchant ID.
