##Quick Config Actions
PrestaShop allows you to perform quick actions on your installed modules such as disabling the plugin on specific devices or uninstalling it. Although not technically part of the Quick Config Actions sub-menu, you also have access to the **Configure** button. Clicking on it will take you to the **Oxipay Configuration**. 

Below is a summary of how to bring up the **Quick Config Actions** sub-menu:

**1** - Log into your PrestaShop admin panel.

**2** - Hover over the **Modules and Services** option on the left side menu, then click on the **Modules and Services** item on the sub-menu that appears.

**3** - This will re-direct you to the **List of Modules** page.

**4** - Scroll down until you bring the **Modules List** panel into focus and  type **Oxipay** in the search field in the panel's top left corner. This will bring the Oxipay module into focus and filter out all other modules.

**5** - If you want to bring up the full **Oxipay Configuration** page, then click on the **Configure** button.

**6** - Otherwise, clicking on the arrow next to the **Configure** button will open a drop-down menu similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.

Here is a quick summary of the various **Configure** options available to you:

* **Disable**: Disables the plugin but leaves it installed on your PrestaShop. You can re-enable it with its existing settings at a later time. Oxipay will not appear as a payment option on your store once disabled.
<hr>
* **Disable on mobiles**: This option disables Oxipay only on mobile devices (or smartphones, such as iPhones). This does not apply to tablets (such as iPads) or desktop computers.
<hr>
* **Disable on tablets**: Disables Oxipay on tablets but not smartphones or desktop computers.
<hr>
* **Disable on computers**: Disables Oxipay on desktop computers only.
<hr>
* **Reset**: Resets the Oxipay module to its original state without any of the configuration settings that have been applied post installation.
<hr>
* **Uninstall**: Uninstalls the plugin from your store. The plugin will still be available and you will be able to install it at a later time without having to upload it again.
<hr>
* **Mark as Favorite**: Marks Oxipay as one of your favourite plugins so that it becomes available from within the **Favourites** category list on the left hand side of the **Modules List** panel.

<hr>

* **Delete**: Completely removes the plugin from your store. The plugin will no longer be available for installation again and the only way to add Oxipay back to your store as a payment method would be to perform the instructions in the [Installing Oxipay](#installing-oxipay) section of the document again.
