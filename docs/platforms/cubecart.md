# Setting up Oxipay on a CubeCart Store

This document outlines the steps needed to install Oxipay on your CubeCart Store.

<div class="panel">
  At the time of writing this article, Oxipay was developed and tested against CubeCart version <code>6.1.1</code>, although the plugin should be compatible with other CubeCart versions. If you encounter any issues, please contact us to resolve them as soon as possible.
</div>

## Installing Oxipay

<div class="panel">
  You will need a <b>Merchant ID</b> and <b>API Key</b> before continuing with the installation procedure. They are required to uniquely identify the Merchant and provide a secure link. If you don't have either of these, please contact <a href="mailto:support@%domain%">support@%domain%</a>
</div>

The plugin can be installed via CubeCart's Admin Control Panel, either manually or automatically using a Token. This section details how to upload the plugin, and install and configure its various parameters for it to work properly.

<div class="panel">
  If you have trouble accessing your CubeCart's Admin Control Panel, please consult CubeCart's official <a href="https://support.cubecart.com/Knowledgebase/List">knowledgebase</a> and <a href="https://forums.cubecart.com/">forums</a>, or your IT department to resolve the issue.

## Configuring Oxipay

<div class="panel">
  This section describes the <b>Module Settings</b> available once you have installed the Oxipay plugin. This includes the Oxipay gateways to communicate with, as well as whether or not to enable Test Mode.  
</div>

**1** - Log into the CubeCart Admin Control Panel as an Administrator.

**2** - Once logged in, you will be presented with your Store's dashboard. From the side menu that appears to the left, scroll to the **Extensions** section and select **Manage Extensions**.

**3** - Under the **Available Extensions** section, select the text **OxiPay** to configure the module settings. Descriptions of the options are listed below.

![config-1.png](/img/platforms/cubecart/config-1.png)
<div class="panel">
  We have intentionally masked the <b>Merchant ID</b> and <b>API Key</b> in this support document. Please contact us and we will advise you of the settings to use.
</div>

<hr>

* **Status** This must be enabled for the payment options to appear during checkout.
<hr>

* **Priority** 	If you have more than one payment gateway, please use this field to define the order they are shown in. A setting of '1' will show it first, '2' second, etc.
<hr>

* **Scope** This allows you to specify whether you want the Oxipay plugin to be available via the Main Website only or the Mobile Website only, or both.
<hr>

* **Default** This must be enabled if you would like Oxipay pre-selected for the Customer as the default payment option.
<hr>

* **Merchant ID** This is the Oxipay Merchant ID that you are provided with as part of your on-boarding when signing-up for Oxipay.
<hr>

* **API Key** The API Key or the Encryption key is a case-sensitive alpha-numeric sequence that is used to authenticate payment requests originating from your Store. It is vital that you protect it and don't provide it to unauthorised individuals.
<hr>

* **Test Mode** Indicates whether to process payments over the live Oxipay Gateway URL resulting in real transactions, or to process it over the Oxipay Sandbox Gateway URL which will produce simulated (test) transactions with no real dollar amounts being debited. By default it should be set to **No** unless we are attempting to diagnose issues on your store to do with Oxipay, or you're testing integrating the plugin with your online CubeCart store.
<hr>

* **Test Gateway URL** This specifies the test Oxipay end-point that the plugin would need to communicate with when **Test Mode** is enabled. This is mainly used for troubleshooting purposes, particularly if we want to simulate test transactions on your CubeCart Store without having real dollar amounts debited from Credit Cards.
<hr>

* **Gateway URL** This specifies the live Oxipay end-point that the plugin would need to communicate with for it to be able to process payments via Oxipay. Note that transactions processed over this URL are real transactions that end up in real dollar amounts being deducted.

<hr>

**4** - Once you have finished making the necessary configuration changes, click the **Save** button.

**5** - **%country%** will be automatically set as an **Enabled Region** in the **Allowed Zones** tab. This must match the Country set in the CubeCart Store Settings.
