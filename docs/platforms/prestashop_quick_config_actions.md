##Quick Config Actions
PrestaShop allows you to perform quick actions on your installed modules such as disabling the plugin on specific devices or uninstalling it. Although not technically part of the Quick Config Actions sub-menu, you also have access to the **Configure** button. Clicking on it will take you to the **EPCarts Configuration**. 

Below is a summary of how to bring up the **Quick Config Actions** sub-menu:

**1** - Log into your PrestaShop admin panel.

**2** - Hover over the **Modules and Services** option on the left side menu, then click on the **Modules and Services** item on the sub-menu that appears.

**3** - This will re-direct you to the **List of Modules** page.

**4** - Scroll down until you bring the **Modules List** panel into focus and  type **EPCarts** in the search field in the panel's top left corner. This will bring the EPCarts module into focus and filter out all other modules.

**5** - If you want to bring up the full **EPCarts Configuration** page, then click on the **Configure** button.

**6** - Otherwise, clicking on the arrow next to the **Configure** button will open a drop-down menu similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.

Here is a quick summary of the various **Configure** options available to you:

* **Disable**: Disables the plugin but leaves it installed on your PrestaShop. You can re-enable it with its existing settings at a later time. EPCarts will not appear as a payment option on your store once disabled.

* **Disable on mobiles**: This option disables EPCarts only on mobile devices (or smartphones, such as iPhones). This does not apply to tablets (such as iPads) or desktop computers.

* **Reset**: Resets the EPCarts module to its original state without any of the configuration settings that have been applied post installation.

<hr>

* **Delete**: Completely removes the plugin from your store. The plugin will no longer be available for installation again and the only way to add EPCarts back to your store as a payment method would be to perform the instructions in the [Installing EPCarts](#installing-EPCarts) section of the document again.
