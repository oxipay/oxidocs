### CVV Values and Outcomes

Oxipay in the sandbox environment allows Credit Cards to dynamically return different results. This is done using CVV values that are used to force certain test outcomes, particularly declines and approvals.

Only a CVV value of 200 will generate a declined; all other values will result in an approval.

|CVV Code|Oxipay Response Code|
|--------|-----------------|
|200|Declined|
|Other values|Approved| -->
