<h1>Accreditation Process</h1>

Once Oxipay is installed on your platform it must be verified before it can process live transactions.<br>
To do this your website must be able to process a test transaction and have it verified by Oxipay.

<div class="panel">
    Before performing the test transaction, <b>test mode</b> must be activated in the Oxipay settings.<br>
    Please refer to the documentation for your platform.
